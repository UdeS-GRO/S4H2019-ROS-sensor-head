# Assembly Process

![full assy](https://github.com/gene2302/3-axis-ROS-sensor-head/blob/master/Hardware/Images/3-axis-iso.PNG)

1 - Download BOM.
	[Excel BOM](https://github.com/gene2302/3-axis-ROS-sensor-head/blob/master/Hardware/BOM/BOM.xlsx)

2 - Purchase required standards parts.

You need purchase some standard part from Servocity, dynamixel and McMaster for exemple. All links are in the BOM excel.

3 - 3D print all 3d printed parts

You need to print all pieces and respect qty. 

Caracteritics for PLA printing:

Layer high : 0,2mm
Extruder temp: 195-205 degC
Infill : 10 to 60 % Diamond infill

4 - Assembly the Z module:

Take the Z motor, fix the adapter_gear on the motor with 4 screws m2.5.
Fix the bevel_gear on it. Screw the motor with the base. Fix the other bevel-gear on the 2in shaft. Place one bearing in the bearing hole. Place the other bearing in the top plate bearing hole. This is "pressfit" hole.
Finaly, join top plate with the base and srew it with 3X m3 SHCS.

5 - Assembly the X module:

Take the X motor (XM-430-w350) and screw the motor adaptor (item no ...). Place bearing support (2x) and spacer with screw #6-32(2x). Screw the shaft adaptor under the 3d printed piece with 4x #6-32.
Align shaft, bearing, spacer and ring for complete the assy.

6 - Assembly the Y module:

Take the Y motor(XM-430-w250) and screw the motor adaptor on it. Plug 1in shaft in the adaptor motor. Next, screw 2x bearing supports and 2x bore bottom with the 3d printed y-plate (#6-32). Place the other shaft with a collet and spacer. 

7 - Assembly the full module.

take all the modules and assemble them together with the appropriate screws and according to the image.
